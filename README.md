# Denomon

The protocol for monorepo project development.

## What is Denomon?

Denomon is essentially a protocol meaning that it provides a set of guidelines
with the aim to ease by clarifying each concern of your project. It comes as a
repository template with a devcontainer configuration for enclosed and isolated
development setup, that gives a clear and intuitive structure to your project by
respecting the role of each piece of its content, giving it a place and a name.

This structure enables a simple CLI that lives inside this setup and helps you
manage each aspect of your project.

Denomon brings its own practices and conventions, but it does not hide anything
from you, although it tries to be as subtle as possible everything is under the
sun and you can control and edit any part of it (including the CLI itself, with
obvious trade-offs).
