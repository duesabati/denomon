# Denomon

A protocol for monorepo project development.

## What is Denomon?

Denomon is essentially a _protocol_ meaning that it provides a set of guidelines
with the aim to ease development by clarifying each concern of your project.

It comes as a repository template with a devcontainer configuration for enclosed
and isolated development setup, that gives a clear, intuitive and consistent
structure to your project by respecting the role of each piece of its content,
giving it a place and a name.

This structure enables a simple CLI that lives literally inside this setup and
helps you manage each aspect of your project.

While Denomon brings its own practices and conventions, it does not hide
anything from you, although it tries to be as subtle as possible everything is
under the sun and you can control and edit any part of it (including the CLI
itself).
